This is a simple sparse library developed at the Institute for Numerical
Mathematics, University of Ulm, for teaching purposes. It contains sparse
matrix storage formats, operations for said formats, mesh generation
routines and solvers.

To get started you need
    * a C build environment and
    * a "make" tool.

Before building, checkout the files options.inc and system.inc for compilation
and system settings.

git it, make it and have fun!
